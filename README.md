# Craft Basic Template
A bare-bones framework for Craft, for a quicker start to templates.

## Installation

1. [Install Craft](https://craftcms.com/docs/installing) as normal.
2. Copy /craft/config/general.php into your folder structure and set your own custom control panel trigger word. This changes it from the default of /admin to /my-custom-admin, e.g. /cms. Make sure to also update the assets folder to the folder you will be using in your /public folder. Note, your server set-up may call this root folder /httpdocs.
